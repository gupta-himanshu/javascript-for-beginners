##Advantages of JavaScript
###The merits of using JavaScript are:
1. **Less server interaction**: We can validate user input before sending the
page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on
your server.
2. **Immediate feedback to the visitors**: Users don't have to wait for a
page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
3. **Increased interactivity**: We can create interfaces that react when the
user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
4. **Richer interfaces**: We can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-
and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to our site
visitors.

##Limitations of JavaScript
###We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features:
1. Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files.
2. JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no
such support available.
3. JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.

##Important notes:-
1. The HTML comment closing sequence `-->` is not recognized by JavaScript, so it should be written as `//-->`.
2. If we want to have a script run on some event, such as when a user
clicks somewhere, then we have to place that script within the `<head>...</head>`
tags.
3. If we need a script to run as the page loads so that the script
generates content in the page, then the script goes in the `<body>`
portion of the document. In this case, we cannot have any function
defined using javascript.
